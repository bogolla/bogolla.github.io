        <p>AngularJS creates live templates as a view. Views are interpolated when the view is evaluated with one or more variable substitu-
            tions; the result is that the variables in our string are replaced with values.</p>
        <p>Angular runs its own event loop to check if a value is dirty. A value is considered dirty if it has changed since the last time the event loop ran.
            This is how Angular is able to track and respond to changes in the app. The event loop is called the $digest() loop</p>
        <p>To denote internals and other built-in library functions, Angular uses the $ to prepend objects.</p>


        <!-- to bind references in the views by an attribute on an object, rather than
    the raw object itself. -->
        <br><h4>{{ clock.now }}</h4><br>
        <!--bind the “name” property to the input field using the ng-model directive on the containing model object ( $scope ).-->
        <input type="text" ng-model="name" placeholder="Your Name">
        <p>Hallo {{ name }}</p>
